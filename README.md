## 🧠 Project Design (Why Hybrid Chatbot?)

Instead of relying entirely on live AI APIs (which can be slow or unreliable on free tiers), SakhiAI uses a **hybrid approach**:

- ✅ Rule-based logic for common and predictable queries  
- ❌ No dependency on external AI APIs for core functionality  
- 🔁 AI layer can be plugged in later if required  

This ensures:
- Fast response time  
- Reliable demos  
- Stress-free interviews
